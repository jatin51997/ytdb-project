### Rate and Review Channels 🌟

Similar to IMDb, our web app allows users to **rate and review YouTube channels**, empowering the community to identify and showcase the best content creators out there.

### Sophisticated Rating Algorithm 📊

We've designed a sophisticated rating algorithm that takes multiple factors into account to provide a channel rating out of 5. As users rate channels, the system evolves to reflect their preferences.

### Discover Trending Channels 🔥

Explore trending channels across various categories, so you can always stay updated with what's hot on YouTube, all in one place.

### Personalized Channel Recommendations 🎯

Discover new channels tailored to your preferences. The more you use the system, the smarter it becomes at providing recommendations. You can even maintain a favorite channels list or add channels to your wish list to explore them later.

### Intuitive User Interface 🖥️

Our user-friendly interface, complete with a dark mode feature, allows you to explore new channels comfortably, day or night.

### Secure Authentication 🔐

User data security is a top priority for us. We've implemented Auth0 for seamless and secure user authentication, with faster login and registration processes and zero security breaches.

### Personalized Recommendations Algorithm 🌐

We've taken content discovery to the next level with our graph-based solution for personalized recommendations. Discover how data structures and algorithms play a vital role in enhancing your user experience.
